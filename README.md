- 👋 Hi, I’m Anthony.
- 🏫 I attended Lambda School's 9-month, fully immersive full stack web development bootcamp, where I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, React, Redux, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, and computer science.
- 💻 I've worked as a mentor with Lambda School for 6 months, and have been working with the MERN stack since early 2019.
- 👀 I’m interested in joining a supportive team so that I may learn and grow as a developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python/Django, and have a fairly good grasp of the fundamentals of MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS. I also have experience with PostgreSQL.
